Coding of Ordering Form on Websites

Have you ever thought about the development of online ordering form on different websites? I am a newbie in the area of website development and now, I try to discern about everything which is made with code. I started learning the rules of programming several months ago and now, I try to understand some basic rules. Let’s take this website – www.essayskills.com . It has an ordering form. I guess it is made on the basis of javascript. After that, the necessary information about a customer and the details of his order is sent to the server, where all managers (real people) who process the order see what a customer wants to get. The customer support team will process this order, get in contact with a customer with the aim to specify the details and assign an author who will be responsible for this particular task.
I just wonder, am I right? Are there any other requirements? Maybe there are some other methods of ordering form development?
